Improved string representation for polynomials (__str__)
--------------------------------------------------------

The string representation (``__str__``)of all six polynomial types in
`numpy.polynomial` now use unicode characters to represent powers
on the basis terms. This results in improved interpretability when polynomials
are printed.
